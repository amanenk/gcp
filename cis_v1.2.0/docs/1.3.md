## 1.3 Ensure that Security Key Enforcement is enabled for all admin accounts (Manual)

## Profile Applicability
- Level 2

## Description

Setup Security Key Enforcement for Google Cloud Platform admin accounts.

## Rationale

Google Cloud Platform users with Organization Administrator roles have the highest level
of privilege in the organization. These accounts should be protected with the strongest
form of two-factor authentication: Security Key Enforcement. Ensure that admins use
Security Keys to log in instead of weaker second factors like SMS or one-time passwords
(OTP). Security Keys are actual physical keys used to access Google Organization
Administrator Accounts. They send an encrypted signature rather than a code, ensuring
that logins cannot be phished.

## Impact

If an organization administrator loses access to their security key, the user could lose
access to their account. For this reason, it is important to set up backup security keys.

## Default Value
By default, Security Key Enforcement is not enabled for Organization Administrators.
